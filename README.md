# Particles Art One - By angklun  (Cesar Herrera)

Piece of digital art using a particle system.

## Description

This is a simple project using opengl 440 and a particle system in order to simulate some visual movement of the particles, 
the main goal was to simulate water and try to shape it so its visually interesting with some color palettes and maybe some obstacles,
BUT so far its not there yet, so for now I'm displaying something that seems to be a lot of big bangs but in reverse.

Some visuals of the current status of the project (21/10/2024):



## Getting Started

### Dependencies

* Visual Studio 2019 or more
* Add the opengl32.dll to the system32 folder, this is usual for opengl projects (just make it once for all projects)
* Linking libraries
  * GLFW (for opengl)
  * GLEW (for window management)
  * SOIL2 (for texture)
  * GLM (for math)

### Installing

* Add the opengl32.dll to the system32 folder, this is usual for opengl projects (just make it once for all projects)
* Link all the libraries (you can check the videos from [Suraj Sharma](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxov_ZhJoG4))

### Executing program

Since this is not yet built for release or anything similar
* Just hit play at visual studio


## Help

If the project isn't running, might need to do correctly the linking of the libraries, please check the videos from Suraj Sharma(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxov_ZhJoG4)
